# 36 Keys

![Kyria 36 keys](../img/kyria-36keys.png)

This case fits a full size kyria but only 36 switches footprints are accessible.

I exported two versions, one for a 3mm plate with 6mm standoffs, which is compatible with the [acrylic plate case from splitkb](https://splitkb.com/collections/cases-and-plates/products/kyria-acrylic-plate-case). And one for a 1.5mm plate with 7mm standoffs.

If you want to use a plate with a different thickness or different standoffs, you can modify the two global parameters in the fusion project, and export the modified files yourself. (And don't forget to mirror the parts!)

You need M2 screws to assemble the case, if you're using a 1.5mm plate with 7mm standoffs, the max screw length should be around 4mm, and for a 3mm plate with 6mm standoffs, it's 5mm.
